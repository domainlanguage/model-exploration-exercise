          Eventually, yes, probably. But first we just need to know it is off-track, and for that we need to know where
          it is!

          You've given us this nice Cargo screen that has the itinerary, etc. Couldn't cargo location be on there? And
          maybe in red if it is not on the itinerary?

          the shipping from wherever it wound up to the destination.
          If it is late, then it might cost more.

          When they tell us the cargo is in Singapore, which is not in the itinerary, then we reroute?

        <div class="answer-text">
          Well, first we’d want to verify. After all, in Hong
          Kong, they said they loaded it onto a particular
          vessel voyage, and that ship never went near
          Singapore. So someone is wrong! But who? We
          would ask for verification from Singapore. But
          flagging it in the system, notifying someone,
          that’s the key.

          Cargo starts with an itinerary of HKG-LGB-SEA, and the Vendor Handling Report shows it
          was loaded in HKG onto its proper Vessel
          Voyage. But then someone messages me from
          Singapore and tells me they have it. I look in the
          report, and it was unloaded in SNG! So the
          current location would be SNG, and the cargo is
          misdirected. And now we have some work to do.

          Oh, all this data is completely normal. Cargoes get misdirected every day.

        <div class="question-text">Maybe pirates took the cargo off the ship headed to LGB, and put it on the ship that
          landed in SNG.

        <div class="answer-text">
          I don't think pirates do that. More likely aliens.
